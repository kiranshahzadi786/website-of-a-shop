    <p>The most charming and well thought out restaurant I have ever been to is The Cake Bake Shop. As you walk through the door, it feels as if you have been transported to Paris. The service and food is absolutely amazing, and the music echoing throughout the room makes the experience so wonderful and relaxing.

    This adds nicely to the pink Parisian atmosphere given off at the restaurant. Each worker is genuinely nice and helpful. They keep everything in the restaurant clean and well maintained. I never feel unwelcomed or uncomfortable while eating there. The Cake Bake Shop has a very European and Parisian decorative style. The restaurant is in a small, all white cottage house, which has a very warm and cozy feeling to it. The inside is decorated with crystal chandeliers, pink and white lights, marbled tables, and giant pink petal trees. It feels as if you are eating at a café in Paris. At the back of the restaurant, there is a long rectangular window that allows customers to watch the desserts and pastries being made. Quiet jazz plays throughout the restaurant, which really adds to the overall atmosphere making it very peaceful and relaxing.
